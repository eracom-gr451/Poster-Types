OFL FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions about the SIL Open Font License (OFL)
Version 1.1-update4 - Sept 2014
(See http://scripts.sil.org/OFL for updates)

1.1  Can I use the fonts for a book or other print publication, to create logos or other graphics or even to manufacture objects based on their outlines?
Yes. You are very welcome to do so. Authors of fonts released under the OFL allow you to use their font software as such for any kind of design work. No additional license or permission is required, unlike with some other licenses. Some examples of these uses are: logos, posters, business cards, stationery, video titling, signage, t-shirts, personalised fabric, 3D-printed/laser-cut shapes, sculptures, rubber stamps, cookie cutters and lead type.
